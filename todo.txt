Features:
- Camera
    - can be fixed to something
    - can be used to configure the screen
- Vector field for forces
- Mobile vs regular entities
- Attach external forces to states or to entities
    - use case: gravity to attach to a state
    - use case: knockback on an entity
- Better handling of events
- Scene vs Environment???
- Three types of data:
    - transient scene data (created when entering scene, destroyed when leaving)
    - static scene data (attached to the scene instance, not destroyed when leaving the scene but only accessible when in the scene)
        - perhaps some fourth type that is available in multiple scenes, but not all?
    - game data (attached to the game/statemachine, available to every scene)
- mutable and immutable access
- somehow make a class for sidescroller (maybe a subclass of camera? or some sort of state?)
    - also one for where the camera is locked to the player

Misc:
- No need to be too fancy off the get go:
    - e.g.: don't make something a property until it has to be
    - e.g.: don't make something a required abstract method until it has to be
